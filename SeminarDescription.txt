Topic: A Software Architecture for Scalable, Well-Conditioned Internet Services
Student: Peter Donald (pjdonald)
Supervisors: Samar Singh and John Rankin
Summary:

Traditional software architectures are not well suited to the high 
concurrency and load conditioning requirements of busy Internet 
servers. It is not uncommon for Internet servers to experience load 
spikes that are several orders of magnitude greater than the average 
load. An event-driven architecture will be presented where the 
application consists of a directed graph of stages. Each stage is a 
reusable software component that encapsulates a subset of application 
functionality. The stages are instrumented and tuning parameters are 
dynamically adjusted to achieve application defined goals such as 
an upper bound on response time or maximizing throughput.
